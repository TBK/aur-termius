<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>Last updated: May 30, 2018</p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with https://www.termius.com
    website and Termius mobile application (the "Service") operated by Crystalnix Limited ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our website and Termius mobile application (the
    "Service").</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These
    Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms
    then you may not access the Service.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a
    recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis,
    depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless
    you cancel it or Crystalnix Limited cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
    account management page or by contacting Crystalnix Limited customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
    You shall provide Crystalnix Limited with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
    state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
    you automatically authorize Crystalnix Limited to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any
    such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Crystalnix Limited will issue an electronic invoice
    indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
    the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
<h2>Free Trial</h2>
<p>Crystalnix Limited may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time
    ("Free Trial").</p>
<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Crystalnix
    Limited until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your
    Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you
    have selected.</p>
<p>At any time and without notice, Crystalnix Limited reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the
    Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
<h2>Fee Changes</h2>
<p>Crystalnix Limited, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
    Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Crystalnix Limited will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
    opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to
    pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Crystalnix Limited on a case-by-case basis and
    granted in sole discretion of Crystalnix Limited.</p>
<h2>Accounts</h2>
<p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or
    actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
<p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of
    any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name
